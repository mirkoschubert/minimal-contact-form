Almost everyone needs a contact form for their website. But you quickly realize that it is not that easy to find a suitable plugin.

Either you end up with huge form builders that are simply too bulky for a single contact form, or you find a small plugin that doesn't meet your requirements.

### Features

**Minimal Contact Form** is designed to address precisely this problem:

* It is a simple contact form without a lot of extras.
* All form fields are validated and sanitized.
* You can choose to whom the emails are sent.
* The form data is sent via AJAX.
* Sending with WP Mail (SMTP) or PHP Mail is selectable.
* No annoying captchas are used for spam detection, but the honeypot method.
* Predefined GDPR-compliant messages with or without checkbox will be displayed.
* Those messages are linked directly to the privacy policy.
* In case of consent, the recipient will be informed directly in the e-mail.
* The plugin is completely translatable (English & German already available).

All this with a total of **four** settings!

### Requirements

* Due to the new privacy options, this plugin requires WordPress 4.9.6 or up.
* You must setup a privacy policy page in WordPress.

### Translations

If you want to translate this plugin into another language, you are welcome! English and German (informal) are already there. I used the plugin [Loco Translate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/), but I suppose that other ways should be compatible as well.
